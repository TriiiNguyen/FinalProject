## Description
Alert_Me is an easy to use website that is meant to be a resource for those suffereing from all forms of domestic abuse that have no means of aquiring help because they are either under threat or afraid of the repercussions of seeking help and the abuser finding out.
-----------------------------------------

## Installation Instructions
This will be a deployed website.

-----------------------------------------

## Usage
Alert_Me is meant to be an incognito page on the web where users will go in and it will look like a regular website with news articles and other features that are meant to distract from the page's main function. When the user goes to 'sign up' they will be prompter to add their first emergency contact which will be used to send a sms message letting the contact know they are in danger so they may reach out to authorities when they click the 'help' button. The website will have a subtle 'switch' button that will be at the bottom right of the page at all times and will enable the user to switch between all the resources on the page including adding, updating, and deleting  emergency contacts, adding reports of incidents, and local resources and the ingocnito 'news' page. The switch functionality is used incase the user is around the abuser so they can easily hide what they are doing and go back and forth.
